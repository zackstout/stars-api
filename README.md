# Stars API
Building an API that will return data about stars (apparent brightness, distance, luminosity, temperature, etc.). The first step is to scrape Wikipedia for the information -- I accomplished this using [node-wikipedia](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-wikipedia). The next step will be to store this information in a database.
